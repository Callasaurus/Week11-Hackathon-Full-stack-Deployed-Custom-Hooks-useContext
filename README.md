# Week11 Hackathon: Full stack Deployed Custom Hooks & useContext: IMAGORIUM

This is an application that I created during the week 11 hackathon day at School of Code. We were tasked to: create a full-stack app; deploy the front and back end; use a custom React hook and use the useContext hook. My team and I created IMAGORIUM - an app that helps you find your next screensaver. It works by calling an API (through a custom hook that can be used for any API calls) and interacts with a RESTful API and a PostgresSQL database to add and delete images.
